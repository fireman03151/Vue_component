# Ant Design of Vue

Following the Ant Design specification, we developed a Vue UI library `antd` that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

<div class="pic-plus">

  <span>+</span>
  <img width="160" src="https://cn.vuejs.org/images/logo.png">
</div>

<style>
.pic-plus > * {
  display: inline-block !important;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
.pic-plus span {
  font-size: 30px;
  color: #aaa;
  margin: 0 20px;
}
</style>

## Features

- An enterprise-class UI design language for web applications.

- Server-side Rendering

## Installation

### Using npm or yarn

**We recommend using npm or yarn to install**，it not only makes development easier，but also allow you to take advantage of the rich ecosystem of Javascript packages and tooling.

```bash
$ npm install ant-design-vue --save
```

```bash
$ yarn add ant-design-vue
```

If you are in a bad network environment，you can try other registries and tools like [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

> **Using the new features of vue, like `slot-scope`(2.5.0+), `provide / inject`(2.2.0+)**

### Import in Browser

Add `script` and `link` tags in your browser and use the global variable `antd`.

We provide `antd.js` `antd.css` and `antd.min.js` `antd.min.css` under `ant-design-vue/dist` in antd's npm package. You can also download these files directly from [![jsdelivr](https://data.jsdelivr.com/v1/package/npm/ant-design-vue/badge)](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/ant-design-vue) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/ant-design-vue/dist/).

> **We strongly discourage loading the entire files** this will add bloat to your application and make it more difficult to receive bugfixes and updates. Antd is intended to be used in conjunction with a build tool, such as [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), which will make it easy to import only the parts of antd that you are using.

> Note: you should import moment before using antd.js.

## Usage

```jsx
import Vue from 'vue';
import { DatePicker } from 'ant-design-vue';
Vue.use(DatePicker);
```

And import stylesheets manually:

```jsx
import 'ant-design-vue/dist/antd.css'; // or 'ant-design-vue/dist/antd.less'
```

### Use modularized antd

- Use [babel-plugin-import](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import) (Recommended)

  ```js
  // .babelrc or babel-loader option
  {
    "plugins": [
      ["import", { "libraryName": "ant-design-vue", "libraryDirectory": "es", "style": "css" }] // `style: true` for less
    ]
  }
  ```

  > Note: Don't set `libraryDirectory` if you are using webpack 1.

  This allows you to import components from antd without having to manually import the corresponding stylesheet. The antd babel plugin will automatically import stylesheets.

  ```jsx
  // import js and css modularly, parsed by babel-plugin-import
  import { DatePicker } from 'ant-design-vue';
  ```

- Manually import

  ```jsx
  import DatePicker from 'ant-design-vue/lib/date-picker'; // for js
  import 'ant-design-vue/lib/date-picker/style/css'; // for css
  // import 'ant-design-vue/lib/date-picker/style';         // that will import less
  ```
